# Task
In this lab, you will have to find your own data set from an online repository such as https://www.kaggle.com/ or http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php. The data set you choose has only three requirements: 1) it must be in a text file in CSV format, 2) it must have between 100 and 100,000 entries, and 3) it must be meaningful in some way to you. You will create a class for the data in your dataset. You will read from the dataset and fill an ArrayList with objects of your custom class then you will develop a sorting algorithm to sort those objects in an output text file.

1. Download your own dataset.

2. Create a well written class to store each record from your dataset. The members of this class must include all attributes in your dataset. This class must contain the following methods beside the default, parametrized, and copy constructors:

'''java
    @Override
    String toString();
'''
