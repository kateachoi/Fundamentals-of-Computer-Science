# Game

The card game Blind Man’s Bluff usually works as follows: two players are each dealt a card. Without looking at the card, each player places their
card on their forehead face out so that they can see their opponent’s card
value, but they cannot see their own card’s value. Then one player guesses
whether whether or not their card is higher or lower than their opponent’s.
The game is played with a standard French-style 52-card deck, which consists
of cards each with one of 13 ranks (2, 3, . . . , 9, 10, Jack, King, Queen, Ace)
and one of 4 suits (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades). Of course, it is also
possible to play this game using other style of cards.
In this project, we will simulate Blind Man’s Bluff as a one player game,
where the user is dealt a card, shown their opponent’s card, and then asked
to guess if their card is higher or lower. The lowest rank for the card is 2,
3, ... and it ends with King, Queen and Ace on the upper end. If the rank
is the same, the suit is used as a tie-breaker. In a single deck, there are no
duplicates so no games end in a tie.
