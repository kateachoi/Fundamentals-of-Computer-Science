We want to simulate a shopping experience, where all the input comes exclusively from the command line. For each legal request, you will update the amount due subtotal associated with the shopping basket. Once all command line requests have been dispatched, then the sales tax and total due will be computed and displayed. This program is not interactive; the input comes from the command line. Design, implement, and test a well written Java program whose algorithmic flow is:

1. Review the class called **Item** which has a private ItemName (String), and a private ItemPrice (double). All the code for the constructors, getters, and setters has been provided and cannot be modified in any way. Your programming will be written in Lab1 class.

2. Create a method called **setupStore** that returns an array of Items that can be found in the store.

3. Create a method called **createCart**. This method will use ArrayList to create a cart based on the items available in the store. Within this function you should also:
    (a) **Read** a
